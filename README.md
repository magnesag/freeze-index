# Formalization of the Freeze Index Computation

This repository contains the code inherent to Magnes' review and exploration of the freeze index first introduced
in [1]. The implementations reported here in are the ones introduced by Bachlin [2], Cockx [3], Zach [4], in addition
to Moore's [1] and the newly proposed multitaper method.

## Data
In order to be able to run the comparisons and evaluate the various configurations, the Daphnet data is required to
be stored in the subdirectory `data/`. The data files (TXT) files are gitignored. The data can be obtained by visiting

accessed on 19.08.2024.

## Comparing Definitions
To compare FI definitions on the Daphnet dataset, run the script `daphnet_evaluation.py` from root as
```bash
python3.9 run_variants_comparison.py
```
The script will take care of parsing all data files, running the FI computations and comparisons, and save the
resulting plots in the `res/` subdirectory. The `res/` subdirectory is not tracked and automatically generated
if inexistent by the script. Results are sorted by input file and proxy choice.

## Multitaper Parameter Sweep
To run the multitaper parametric sweep and thus to inspect the effects of each parameter of the multitaper method
on the FI run
```bash
python3.9 run_multitaper_sweep.py
```
**NOTE** TO BE ADDED

## Proxy Evaluation
To evaluate the effect of proxy choice on the FI for the multitaper definition, run
```bash
python3.9 run_proxy_sweep.py
```
**NOTE** TO BE ADDED
