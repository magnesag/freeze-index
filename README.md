# Formalization of the Freeze Index Computation

This repository contains the code inherent to Magnes' review and exploration of the freeze index first introduced
in [1]. The implementations reported here in are the ones introduced by Bachlin [2], Cockx [3], Zach [4], in addition
to Moore's [1] and the newly proposed multitaper method.

## Setup

### Requirements
1. Python >=3.9
2. (optional) Latex -- for paper-ready plots set `USE_TEX=True` in `aux/cfg.py`

### Daphnet dataset
The Daphnet Freezing of Gait dataset is used for comparisons. It has a permissive CC BY 4.0 license and the data can be found under `data/` folder.

### Python environment
To manage Python library dependencies, Python virtual environment is used. Run the following from the root project directory:
```sh
# Create Python virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
# Activate it
. ./venv/bin/activate
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Comparing Definitions
To compare FI definitions on the Daphnet dataset, run the script `run_variants_comparison.py` from root project directory as
```bash
python run_variants_comparison.py
```
The script will take care of parsing all data files, running the FI computations and comparisons, and save the
resulting plots in the `res/` subdirectory. The `res/` subdirectory is not tracked and automatically generated
if inexistent by the script. Results are sorted by input file and proxy choice.

## Multitaper Parameter Sweep
To run the multitaper parametric sweep and thus to inspect the effects of each parameter of the multitaper method
on the FI run
```bash
python run_multitaper_sweep.py
```

## Proxy Evaluation
To evaluate the effect of proxy choice on the FI for the multitaper definition, run
```bash
python run_proxy_sweep.py
```
